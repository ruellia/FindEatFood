# FINDEATFOOD

Everyday, thousands of pounds of food get wasted and thrown away. Through wasting food, every year consumers experience a significant lost in their wages. Our app, FINDEATFOOD, allows for users to search for recipes based on ingredients they list. By doing so, our app aims to limit down the amount of waste consumers produce while saving them money.

FINDEATFOOD will enable users to:
* Search for recipes based on ingredients entered.
* Apply dietary restrictions on searches for recipes.
* Save favorite recipes in-app.
